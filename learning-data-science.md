Data science is incredibly broad and complex discipline, an interception of computer science, math and statistics, and a domain of knowledge requiring the understanding the source of data: medical, financial, web, and other domains. The mindmap below contains a condensed introduction to the key data science concepts and techniques that have revolutionized the business landscape and became essential for making beneficial data-driven decisions. We are confident that it will be useful and informative for both the data science managers and for those facing this rapidly developing field as a client or user.

## Python

#### Python Data Science Handbook
https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook
Python Data Science Handbook: full text in Jupyter Notebooks. The book introduces the core libraries essential for working with data in Python: particularly IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and related packages.

### Numpy 
**NumPy** is an extension library for Python language, supporting operations of a large number of high-dimensional arrays and matrices. In addition, it also provides a large number of mathematical function libraries for array operations. Machine learning involves a lot of transformations and operations on arrays, which makes NumPy one of the essential tools.

#### A Visual Intro to NumPy and Data Representation

#### 100 NumPy Exercises
* Link: https://labex.io/lab/403

Despite its name of "exercises", it's essentially a cheatsheet containing 100 most-frequent usage. 

It is divided into _basic part_ and _advanced part_, each with 50 exercises. The basic part of the exercise helps you familiarize yourself with the use of NumPy's common methods and the advanced part focuses on the combined application of the NumPy methods.
